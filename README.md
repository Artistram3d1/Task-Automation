# Task-Automation
Looking for ways to streamline tasks in Adobe Illustrator. Specifically, to have Illustrator extract information from pdf files to use in Illustrator graphic files. Examples: Extracting panel sizes, substrates and quantities. Once extracted, this info will be put into one Illustrator document.
